QNeedleIndicator v0.3.2

This widget have mostly educational porposes as I wanted try Qt. 
Because a friend of mine found it useful in his project I decided 
to post it on-line.

Open QNeedleIndicator.pro in Qt Creator. Hit compile & run. It should work.
Indicator widget is in qneedleindicator.[cpp,h]. MainWindow is only for
testing and example purposes. All features of QNeedleIndicator are
presented there.

Qt Designer plugin project have to be compiled separately. Enter QNeedleIndicatorPlugin
subdirectory, type qmake & make and copy resulting libQNeedleIndicatorPlugin.so to 
plugins directory.
